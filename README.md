# Memory Control

Design the memory controller and explain data movement, outstanding requests, buffer ownership and safe reuse.

## Start here

1. Read [the current assignment and artifact locations](docs/START-HERE.md).
2. Complete [AI setup and the capture check](docs/git-ai.md) before AI edits or
   your first commit. Every clone needs its local hook activated.
3. Work on a branch and open a PR for `@abhinavnandwani` using
   [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Main requires a code-owner approval;
   admins can bypass.

## Current material and scope

The repo provides design scaffolding. A controller implementation and its verification results are still to be developed.
